Time Complexity:
In worst case scenario, greedy BFS will explore all edges. So Time Complexity will be O(E log V).

Space Complexity:
Space complexity will be O(V), where V is the number of vertices. This is because in the worst case, all nodes might be stored in the priority queue and the visited set.
